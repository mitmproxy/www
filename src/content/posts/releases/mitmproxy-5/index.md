## New Table UI

As a major change, mitmproxy 5.0 comes with the new default table view contributed by <a href="https://github.com/Jessonsotoventura">@Jessonsotoventura</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BkPHcgQL3V">@BkPHcgQL3V</a>. Both hadn't contributed to mitmproxy before, so it's exciting to see a new major feature from fresh contributors. 

We're of course curious and asked Jesson about his first mitmproxy dev experience:

<blockquote>
It all started with @BkPHcgQL3V who built out the original design for the table view. Thankfully, the portion of code base that creates the flow list was self-contained and with a few tweaks to the original UI and some urwid magic the list view became a table view. @BkPHcgQL3V had done all the hard work but the PR stalled out. This is where I came in. I wanted to improve mitmproxy, specifically, I wanted to add a view for plain TCP flows, but I had a couple of problems: first, I didn't know how to use urwid to create a UI and second, I didn't know how mitmproxy worked internally. So while looking for a way to learn the inner workings of mitmproxy, I stumbled upon the stalled PR and forced it alive. I poked and prodded @mhils until he responded and added his suggestions â€“ the ability to switch back to the old list view and color palettes. Once it was merged, I started to use the UI and sure enough it makes using mitmproxy more convenient. So give it a go, find bugs, post issues, make pull requests, and keep an eye out for a couple new views leveraging the table view in the near future.

## iOS 13

We've been a bit lazy with shipping a 4.x patch release, but mitmproxy 5 finally brings support for iOS 13. Contributed by <a href="https://github.com/vin01">@vin01</a>, we now generate certificates that include an ExtendedKeyUsage extension. You may need to delete your existing mitmproxy CA (<code>~/.mitmproxy</code>) and generate a new one by restarting mitmproxy.


## Security Fixes

This release also includes two security fixes:

* Fixed command injection vulnerabilities when exporting flows as curl/httpie commands. (<a href="https://github.com/cript0nauta">@cript0nauta</a>)
* Do not echo unsanitized user input in HTTP error responses. (<a href="https://github.com/fimad">@fimad</a>)

Most users should be unaffected, but please upgrade nonetheless!
