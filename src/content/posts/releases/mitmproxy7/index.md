We're delighted to announce the release of mitmproxy 7. This release is all about our new proxy core,
which bring substantial improvements across the board and represents a massive milestone for the project.

## What's in the release?

In this post we'll focus on some of the user-facing improvements coming with mitmproxy 7. If you are interested
in the technical details of our new sans-io proxy core, check 
out our [blog post]({{< relref "new-proxy-core" >}}) dedicated to that!


### Full TCP Support

{{< figure src="tcp.png" >}}

Mitmproxy now supports proxying raw TCP connections out of the box, including ones that start with a server-side 
greeting -- for example SMTP. [Opportunistic TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS) (`STARTTLS`) is not 
supported yet, but regular TCP-over-TLS just works!


### HTTP/1 â‡” HTTP/2 Interoperability

{{< figure src="http-interop.svg" >}}

Mitmproxy can now accept HTTP/2 requests from the client and forward them to an HTTP/1 server. This on-the-wire protocol translation works bi-directional: All HTTP requests and responses were created equal!. This change also makes it possible to change the request destination for 
HTTP/2 flows, which previously was not possible at all.

### WebSocket Message Display

{{< figure src="websocket.png" >}}

Mitmproxy now displays WebSocket messages not only in the event log, but also in a dedicated UI tab!
There are still UX details to be ironed out, but we're excited to ship a first prototype here. While this is only for the console UI via mitmproxy, the web UI via mitmweb is still looking for amazing contributors to get feature parity!

### Secure Web Proxy (TLS-over-TLS)

{{< figure src="tls-over-tls.svg" >}}

Clients usually talk in plaintext to HTTP proxies -- telling them where to connect -- before they ultimately establish 
a secure TLS connection through the proxy with the destination server. With mitmproxy 7, clients can now establish TLS 
with the proxy right from the start (before issuing an HTTP `CONNECT` request), 
which can add a significant layer of defense in public networks. 

So instead of simply specifying `http://127.0.0.1:8080` you can now also use HTTPS via `https://127.0.0.1:8080` (or any other listen host and port).


### Windows Support for Console UI

{{< figure src="windows.png" >}}

Thanks to an experimental [urwid patch](https://github.com/urwid/urwid/pull/448), mitmproxy's console UI
is now natively available on Windows. While the Window Subsystem for Linux (WSL) has been a viable alternative
for a while, we're very happy to provide the same tools across all platforms now.

### API Reference Documentation

{{< figure src="pdoc.svg" width=100 >}}

Having recently adopted the [pdoc](https://pdoc.dev) project, which generates awesome Python API documentation, 
we have built a completely [new API reference documentation](https://docs.mitmproxy.org/archive/v7/api/events.html) for mitmproxy's 
addon API. Paired with our existing [examples on GitHub](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/tree/main/examples), 
this makes it much simpler to write mitmproxy new addons.

## What's next?

While this release focuses heavily on our backend, the next mitmproxy release will come with lots of mitmweb 
improvements by our current GSoC 2021 student [@gorogoroumaru](https://github.com/gorogoroumaru). Stay tuned!

## Release Changelog
