We are happy to announce the release of [mitmproxy 6.0](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/releases/tag/v6.0.0)! 
While the version bump may suggest otherwise, this really is a bugfix release while we prepare for much larger changes 
in the next version.

## What's in the release?

We've bumped the major version as support for Python 3.6 and 3.7 has been dropped.
But don't let that fool you --- it's really mostly bugfixes. Everybody should upgrade!

## What's coming up?

Apparently not all complete rewrites are doomed: We are on the final stretch to replace our current
proxy core with a completely rewritten sans-io implementation in 
[#4343](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/pull/4343). We will follow up with a separate blog post
detailing this massive undertaking in the coming days.
