We're thrilled to announce the release of mitmproxy 12, introducing *Interactive Contentviews*!
It's now possible to modify the prettified representation of binary protocols, 
which is then re-encoded back into the original binary format.

# Interactive Contentviews

First [introduced in 2011], the ability to pretty-print HTTP message bodies has been a mitmproxy feature 
since the very early days.
The functionality later became a shared component between the console and web interfaces 
in 2015 ([#764]), soon followed by support for custom user-provided views ([#833]). 
However, these views were always read-only; editing binary protocols meant changing raw bytes.

Now, with interactive contentviews, you can directly edit the human-readable, prettified representation,
and mitmproxy will handle the task of re-encoding it back into its binary form.
This dramatically simplifies tinkering with unknown binary protocols such as gRPC/Protobuf or MsgPack.

## Spotlight: gRPC & Protobuf

The prime example of interactive contentviews is our enhanced gRPC and Protobuf support.
You can now modify Protobuf messages directly within mitmproxy, 
whether you have access to the Protobuf definitions (`.proto` files) or not.

- **Known Protobufs:** Set the new [`protobuf_definitions`] option in mitmproxy to your `.proto` file 
  and edit fields by name.
- **Unknown Protobufs:** You won't have field names, but you can still interactively modify primitive values 
  (strings, integers, nested messages) and mitmproxy will re-encode your changes.

## New Contentview API

Underpinning this interactivity is a revamped and drastically simpler Contentview API. 
Instead of returning a list of lines with inline markup, 
the new [`prettify`] method simply takes `bytes` and returns `str`, and then [`reencode`] does the reverse.
As an example, here's a simple interactive contentview that dumps and parses data as hex:

```python
from mitmproxy import contentviews

class Hex(contentviews.InteractiveContentview):
    def prettify(
        self, 
        data: bytes,
        metadata: contentviews.Metadata
    ) -> str:
        return data.hex()

    def reencode(
        self,
        prettified: str,
        metadata: contentviews.Metadata
    ) -> bytes:
        return bytes.fromhex(prettified)

contentviews.add(Hex)
```

Adding this to mitmproxy is as easy as `mitmproxy -s example.py`,
please check out our [new contentview documentation] for more examples!

## Rust-based Contentviews ðŸ¦€

With the new Contentview API, we're also increasing our investment in Rust:

- **Contentviews can now be written in Rust.** 
  Access to the crates.io ecosystem (and [Serde] in particular) makes it easy to write safe and performant
  contentviews. The new gRPC, Protobuf, and MsgPack contentviews are all Rust-based.
- **Syntax highlighting is now done centrally in Rust.** For mitmproxy and mitmweb, the [mitmproxy-highlight] crate does
  all the work (using [tree-sitter] under the hood). Contentviews only need to declare their output format.
  This is much more efficient than the previous implementation, where every contentview had to do highlighting itself.
